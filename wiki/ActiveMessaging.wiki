= ActiveMessaging =

!ActiveMessaging is an attempt to bring the simplicity and elegance of rails development to the world of messaging. Messaging, (or event-driven architecture) is widely used for enterprise integration, with frameworks such as Java's JMS, and products such as ActiveMQ, Tibco, IBM MQSeries etc.

Here's a sample of a processor class that handles incoming messages:
{{{
class HelloWorldProcessor < ActiveMessaging::Processor
  
  subscribes_to :hello_world
  
  def on_message(message)
    puts "received: " + message
  end
  
end
}}}
